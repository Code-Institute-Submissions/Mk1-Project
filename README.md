### **Practical**
The practical purpose of this site is to showcase my abilities as a developer and to put in to practice 
the knowledge i have aquired over the period of my course. This site concept of this pratical application
is to create a predominatly css and html focus, With a view to allow further development. As such the site
is constructed with Bootstrap as a partial base with custom css overlaying to show a understanding of both elements.

### **Theoretical**
1. **New Clients**: The site is intended to provide a marketing platform,
providing access to information on the services provided and imagery of
the products available. The site is built on the premise that potential clients
will already have a event in mind when coming to the site and showcasing a variety 
of events could keep 'GingerNut Catering' in mind for smaller or bigger events.

can further investigate the product they are looking for. The contact page provides them 
with a non commital process to start their enquiry

2. **Existing Clients**: Existing Clients will be able to keep up to date with new popup events
where they can join us, Keep up to date with seasonal menus and free recipes. The contact
page provides the samae benefits to a existing client as it does to new clients.

Frontend Development Milestone Project",  as part of his Full-Stack Developer Diploma 
course from [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/), through Edinburgh Napier University. He has been a part of the hospitality

- < !--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Sub-Section - Start -->
- < !-- Code Comment -->

# **6 Deployment**

Although constructed on Gitpod, the site and all of it's code and assets areas are
hosted on GitHub. So as to prevent the potential loss of data and to allow access to 
all development work carried out on the site, even that not used, the two platforms
are regularly "sync'd". This is a three part process carried out using the Terminal
Window:

1. All code is added to the temporary git directory using the [git add .] command. 
This adds all files that have been changed.

2. "Added" files can then be committed to the git repository using the [git commit -m""] 
command. The reason for each commit is included by way of a comment.
3. Deployment is the final step and publishes the most up to date version to the 
publicly available front end on GitHub pages. It's done using the [git push] command.

All versions are held on the master branch.

Prior to deployment, the site could be viewed in real time by adding the following
command to the terminal window, and selecting "Open Browser" from the modal that
displays: python3 -m http.server

### **Practical**
The practical purpose of this site is to showcase my abilities as a developer and to put in to practice 
the knowledge i have aquired over the period of my course. This site concept of this pratical application
is to create a predominatly css and html focus, With a view to allow further development. As such the site
is constructed with Bootstrap as a partial base with custom css overlaying to show a understanding of both elements.

### **Theoretical**
1. **New Clients**: The site is intended to provide a marketing platform,
providing access to information on the services provided and imagery of
the products available. The site is built on the premise that potential clients

can further investigate the product they are looking for. The contact page provides them 
with a non commital process to start their enquiry

2. **Existing Clients**: Existing Clients will be able to keep up to date with new popup events
where they can join us, Keep up to date with seasonal menus and free recipes. The contact
page provides the samae benefits to a existing client as it does to new clients.

Frontend Development Milestone Project",  as part of his Full-Stack Developer Diploma 
course from [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/), through Edinburgh Napier University. He has been a part of the hospitality

# **6 Deployment**

Although constructed on Gitpod, the site and all of it's code and assets areas are
hosted on GitHub. So as to prevent the potential loss of data and to allow access to 
all development work carried out on the site, even that not used, the two platforms
are regularly "sync'd". This is a three part process carried out using the Terminal
Window:

1. All code is added to the temporary git directory using the [git add .] command. 
This adds all files that have been changed.

2. "Added" files can then be committed to the git repository using the [git commit -m""] 
command. The reason for each commit is included by way of a comment.
3. Deployment is the final step and publishes the most up to date version to the 
publicly available front end on GitHub pages. It's done using the [git push] command.

All versions are held on the master branch.

Prior to deployment, the site could be viewed in real time by adding the following
command to the terminal window, and selecting "Open Browser" from the modal that
displays: python3 -m http.server

# **6 Deployment**

Although constructed on Gitpod, the site and all of it's code and assets areas are
hosted on GitHub. So as to prevent the potential loss of data and to allow access to 
all development work carried out on the site, even that not used, the two platforms
are regularly "sync'd". This is a three part process carried out using the Terminal
Window:

1. All code is added to the temporary git directory using the [git add .] command. 
This adds all files that have been changed.

2. "Added" files can then be committed to the git repository using the [git commit -m""] 
command. The reason for each commit is included by way of a comment.
3. Deployment is the final step and publishes the most up to date version to the 
publicly available front end on GitHub pages. It's done using the [git push] command.

All versions are held on the master branch.

Prior to deployment, the site could be viewed in real time by adding the following
command to the terminal window, and selecting "Open Browser" from the modal that
displays: python3 -m http.server

# **6 Deployment**

Although constructed on Gitpod, the site and all of it's code and assets areas are
hosted on GitHub. So as to prevent the potential loss of data and to allow access to 
all development work carried out on the site, even that not used, the two platforms
are regularly "sync'd". This is a three part process carried out using the Terminal
Window:

1. All code is added to the temporary git directory using the [git add .] command. 
This adds all files that have been changed.

2. "Added" files can then be committed to the git repository using the [git commit -m""] 
command. The reason for each commit is included by way of a comment.
3. Deployment is the final step and publishes the most up to date version to the 
publicly available front end on GitHub pages. It's done using the [git push] command.

All versions are held on the master branch.

Prior to deployment, the site could be viewed in real time by adding the following
command to the terminal window, and selecting "Open Browser" from the modal that
displays: python3 -m http.server
