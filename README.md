# **1 UX**

## **1.1 What is the Site About**
'Ginger Nut Catering' is a private catering company based in Shropshire.
The site is intended to offer information on a range of different catering services, 
from garden parties to wedding and events catering and can operate nationwide. 
There is a variety of preselected menus to choose from as well as being able to discuss 
themes and tastes to build the perfect event catering experience.

The site offers the additional incentive to revisit with the recipe pages available.

Discussion is available to anyone interested in putting on an event through the message feature.
There are regular open events that the site user is invited to attend through the locations page.

## **1.2 What is the Purpose of the Site**
The site has a practical and a theoretical purpose:

### **Practical**
The practical purpose of this site is to showcase my abilities as a developer and 
to put into practice the knowledge I have acquired over the period of my course.
 This site concept of this practical application is to create a predominantly CSS and html focus,
  With a view to allow further development. As such, the site is constructed with Bootstrap 
as a partial base with custom CSS overlaying to show an understanding of both elements.

### **Theoretical**

1. The goal is to provide a concise platform offering information on the services available and
 provide a marketing platform with contact links are available for information requests and bookings.

2. **New Clients**: The site is intended to provide a marketing platform,
providing access to information on the services provided and imagery of
the products available. The site is built on the premise that potential clients
will already have an event in mind when coming to the site and showcasing a variety 
of events could keep 'GingerNut Catering' in mind for smaller or bigger events.
As well as providing recipes and locations of open popup events which a potential client 
can further investigate the product they are looking for. The contact page provides them 
with a non commital process to start their enquiry

3. **Existing Clients**: Existing Clients will be able to keep up to date with new popup events
where they can join us, Keep up to date with seasonal menus and free recipes. The contact
page provides the same benefits to a existing client as it does to new clients.

## **1.3 Who Built the Site and Why**
This site was conceived, designed and built by Peter Freemantle for his first "User Centric 
Frontend Development Milestone Project",  as part of his Full-Stack Developer Diploma 
course from [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/), through Edinburgh Napier University. He has been a part of the hospitality
industry and a chef from 2008-2020.

## **1.4 Concept**

This will be a multiple pages website, the home page will be an image carousel showing  the service, 
product and branded images. A banner with download links underneath with fixed header containing a text banner and navigation bar. 
The Footer will be fixed at the bottom of the page with contact phone numbers and social network links.
The header will keep the banner in both desktop and mobile. In desktop the links will keep across full screen, 
but move to a burger icon when in mobile, allowing for the content to be kept clear and visible.
The navigation menu will contain dropdown link allowing for expansion of pages by leading to some of the page pages broken down by id tags.
 The new menu will have active screens set, allowing the user to know where they are on the site.

The site will be fully responsive and optimized to be viewed on different screen sizes and devices.

## **1.5 User Stories**

As a potential event organiser  who has a rough idea of what I'm looking for I would want to be able to find out where
 I can sample the offering be able to contact the service provider to ask about the request that I have.
I would also be looking to see images of what was on offer and to keep up to date with any upcoming events I could attend.
It needs to be straight forward so I do not feel out of my depth and be able to see if they have the services I am looking for that would be identifiable after entering the website from a google search.

    - Bootstrap Carousel
        - The responive element is not built into this class so i used a clear.gif and set my images as background URls to get around this issue.
    - Website looked streched on larger monitors.
        - This was dealt with by adding in css to the html and body element by adding a maximum width.
    - Logo image for index.html did not show on deployed site
        -This was a filepath issue which was resolved through ChromDevtools and introducing a correct file path.
    - Tab Windows 
        -Matching heights for tabbed windows to oposing images caused a issue as all the windows used the same .tabbed-content css
        this was resolved by using a inline css over ride for height.
